a list of our 'accomplishments', and a Contact Us section that allows you to directly email Alison and Kate by clicking on their email addresses.

When the user types in their name, they will be welcomed and asked to answer a series of questions about the features they
would like in their study spot. Each question has a dropdown menu for the user to select what feature they want in their study space. After
completing each question, a progress bar shows how far in the quiz the user is. After completing the questions and clicking the "Get My
Recommendations" button, the user will be shown a list of their reccommended study spots based on their answers to the questions.

Once the user receives the list of recommended study spots, the user can browse the spots to see the distance from
their current location to each study spot. They can also see pictures of each study spot by clicking on their names.

The user can also access a "Browse Spaces" page and a "Take the Quiz" on the navigation bar at the top of the screen at any time. The user
can also click on the logo to be taken to the homepage.
