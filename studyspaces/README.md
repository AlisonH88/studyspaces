Once on the homepage, users can input their name, view a map of all of the study spaces in the database with their locations and features, or use the Contact Us section to directly email Alison and Kate, the creators of this project.

When users type in their name, they will be welcomed and asked to answer a series of questions about the characteristics of their ideal study spot. Each question has a dropdown menu for users to select their desired feature. After completing each question, a progress bar shows how far in the quiz users are. After answering all questions and clicking the "Get My
Recommendations" button, users will be shown a list of their recommended study spots based on their answers.

Once the user receives the list of recommended study spots, the user can browse the spots to see the distance from
their current location to each study spot. They can also see pictures of each study spot by clicking on the spots' names.

The user can also access a "Browse Spaces" page and a "Take the Quiz" on the navigation bar at the top of the screen at any time, or click on the logo to be taken to the homepage.
